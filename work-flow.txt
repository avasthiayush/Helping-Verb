# Why Helping verb:

  All of us knows that Competitive programming have a confined content to learn or 
  confined errors to face and Competitive programming contents are barely updated 
  Day by day. Like if u learned Dijkstra algorithm 3 years ago and coded that in 
  c/c++ and u want to run same code on compiler today then eventually u will be able 
  to do so because most of the updates in these launguages are about shortening your 
  codes using stl and if u will not be able to do so then in most of the cases u will 
  face four errors (WA,TLE,SIGSEGV,RUNTIME) and u already know why your compiler is throwing
  these errors.
  So at the end u generally needs three things to work on Competitive programming 
  1.IDE(Easily available).
  2.Content-DS and Algo(Easily available).
  3.Practice.

  Now lets have a look in developement. Development is not like as Competitive programming 
  here errors are not in handy amount there are lots and lots of errors(sometimes u will not 
  have any clue why u are facing those) and one more irritating thing is There are so 
  many updates so if u are following any outdated tutorial then i am sure u r going to be 
  screwd up with lots of errors sometime whole functions are going to be changed so there are
  so many magics happen  in developement.
  Lets look at the thing we need to work on development.
  1.Editor(Setup needs a good tutorial).
  2.Content(Lots of content is outdated).
  3.Debugging(This step is too much irrtating and time taking for newbies sometimes whole day
               for removing a single bug).

  So by the help of Helping-Verb U can contact to your batchmates or seniors who have proficient 
  knowledge in the Tech(Development) or Topic(CP) currently u are working on and ask them to provide 
  some good Updated resources and can ask for few pro tips. 


# IDEA 
  Helping-Verb was my idea since starting of My second Year but I didnt gave a value to that at that 
  time but during the quarantine when i started learning Techs. like NodeJs, ExpressJs i was totally
  messed up with lots of new terms and new errors and sometimes i invested all my day to learn that 
  new term or remove that bug and sometimes i realised that writing any statement was not my fault
  But function have been updated now. So i decided to work on Helping-Verb so that upcoming geeks do
  not waste their time on those nerdy bugs and can have good resource support.

# Research 
  I really did an exhaustive research about how i will proceed to work on this project and what tech 
  should i learn for completing this project.

# Today-(20/06/2020) I am starting this project i dont know wheather i will be able to complete this 
  But even if i will go to half of the road i mapped to go. I will be happy cause i worked on my idea.

# Coding/Development
  I am solely not supporting any indivisual but in my opinion for the 1st year you should do CP in decent 
  way and learn git/basic web developement/github and in second year do both in a balance manner so that
  one should not have to face lack of time because of other.
  For me:
  1. Coding gives me internal happiness.
  2. Development get to realise me i am develping something Usable,Productive,Worthy in Real time.
  So i like both Coding and Development.
